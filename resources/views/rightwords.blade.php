                Some poems don’t really talk much
            </p>
            <p>
                instead some sprout limbs and learn to walk
            </p>
            <p>
                up and down the city with one word
            </p>
            <p>
                following the other.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Bare
            </p>
            <p>
                hands, feet
            </p>
            <p>
                This verse scours the streets to find
            </p>
            <p>
                what it really means
            </p>
            <p>
                The other nod and mutter agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
                to be a poem 
            </p>
            <p>
                to be
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                in this city. One must pay the price
            </p>
            <p>
                after all, words don’t come so easy.
            </p>
            <p>
                But play right and words can be won
            </p>
            <p>
                off a jeepney and its conductor passing by
            </p>
            <p>
                or teased out of a bottle of Tanduay or
            </p>
            <p>
                "peeled off campaign posters on walls.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Right, it's a little cliched, that's all," the quill pen continues. He writes something with wet ink
                into his private, leather-bound journal.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Look for those quick, hesitant glances
            </p>
            <p>
                of those searching love. Wait
            </p>
            <p>
                listen to the thrum of the sidewalk.
            </p>
            <p>
                The right words will come.
