                    “Demonyo”
            </p>
            <p>
                    it still echoes, you
            </p>
            <p>
                    called me one
            </p>
            <p>
                    I said to myself
            </p>
            <p>
                    “you were just pissed”
            </p>

                    “just pissed”

                   <i> DEMONYO!</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                    “pissed again”
            </p>

                    <i>DE</i>... One day,
            </p>
            <p>
                    I stopped going to church
            </p>
            <p>
                    I left it to mama,
            </p>
            <p>
                    to my sister —they’re
            </p>
            <p>
                    not like me:
            </p>

                <p>
                        using the silence
                </p>
                <p>
                        you scaled the distance

                <p>
                        between your rearing

                        and my apathy

                <p>
                        grew out to be a monster?

                    <p>
                            on the floor, waiting to rip someone’s

                    <p>
                            skin. Chunks of plastic and wood —
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            everywhere. At the eye of this storm sat
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            my huddled figure, knees closed to my

                            chest. And I wonder: How did I became

                    <p>
                            exactly like you?
